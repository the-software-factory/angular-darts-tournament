# modules
This folder is a container for all pages.

Each module at the root level is the page of the app and needs to be included in a dedicated folder with the same name
that will host:

```
modules/
  [module]/
    [module].controller.js
    [module].controller.spec.js
    [module].module.js
    [module].view.html
```
